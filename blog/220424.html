        That's right, the first website update! The website is now finally mobile friendly. 
        I've had a number of (justified) complaints about how the website wasn't viewable on mobile and I agree that it's a bit embarassing. 
        No more. You can now view the website on mobile properly and it shouldn't break anymore
        when you zoom in and out on Desktops!

        Thank you to everyone who gave me feedback and again thank you to Bladesy for correcting
        me on my godawful spelling! I'm also looking for a good blog framework so I can create pages like these without
        copypasting the same html file and changing it's content.
