        <h1 class="title">Shootout Showdown</h1>
        This game is my first full length solo project that I am the most proud of. I put the most effort to date into it. This one was also made as a school project. The assignment was really simple. After we were given a tour of a video game museum we had to make an arcade game like the ones on the machines. A game that could be replayed over and over again. I chose a shooting gallery game inspired by Duck Hunt.

        <h2 class="paragraph">THE PROCESS</h2>
        THE PROCESS
        I started off by making a gun system so that we had something to shoot with because a shooting gallery game without guns is just like walking through a museum. Making a gun was really simple. Whenever the player presses the left mouse button, we cast a ray from the eyes of the player to see if we hit something. If we did, we check if it's an enemy and if it is we deal damage. 
        <br>

        </div>
        Next up, because we're making a shooting gallery game we have to add some objects to shoot! I started out with mugs because a mug isn't that hard to model. After that was done I attached a script to it keeping track of health and that was that. Then I stumbled across my first challenge, I have to spawn in objects at random positions. The way I did this was by putting down a bunch of empty objects that only contain a position, I then added all of them to a list and then made a script that spawns them in at one of the random given locations. Lastly, I added a bullet limit because whenever you go to a fair and you see a shooting gallery stand, obviously you don't get unlimited shooting attempts. I decided that 100 bullets was enough and with that I had finished the first prototype of the game.

        </div>
        Now I had to add some variation in objects to prove I can actually 3D model because in order to get a good grade for this semester, I had to make and texture my own models to show that I am capable of making 3D art of my own. So I opened up blender and after about 9 continous hours of modelling I got this vase out of it:

        </div>
        This vase is the thing I put the most hours into. Especially texturing it. I wasn't quite sure what design to paint on it so I just drew a bunch of popular icons from pop culture.
        Stuff like the Batman logo, the Joker, Pepe the frog, you get the idea.
        <br>
        Now that I have finally made a unique model I had to add these to the pool of spawnable targets. I added in a golden mug which is worth 500 points for some variation and a slight dopamine rush.

        <h2 class="paragraph">LESSONS LEARNED</h2>
        The most important thing I learned from this project has to do with art. Not every developer has access to a whole team of professional artists that can put hundreds of hours into a piece to be featured in game. This project essentially forced me to learn blender & 3D art and it was a very fun process. I got an art piece out of it that I am very proud of.
        <br>
        <h2 class="paragraph">CONCLUSION</h2>
        This is the most effort I EVER put into a project and I'm really proud of the final product. I do have plans to come back to this project and polish it further and eventually release it.
        With that said, I present to you Shootout Showdown.
