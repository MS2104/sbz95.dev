        <h1 class="title">Walmart ULTRAKILL</h1>
        For the main assignment of my second college semester we were given a handful of gameplay clips from different 
        games and we were tasked to team up and select a game and recreate the given gameplay video in an 8 week
        timeframe. I teamed up with 3 of my friends and 2 artists and the game we picked was ULTRAKILL. In short, ULTRAKILL is a singleplayer FPS game where the
        player has to navigate through Dante's layers of hell. The goal is simple, defeat waves of enemies and make it
        to the end of the level. While you navigate through the levels you gain style points for specific moves or
        a combination of guns similar to the game Devil May Cry. At the end of the level, you are ranked based on how much time you took to complete
        said level and the number of kills.
        <br>
        <br>
        With that aside, this is the gameplay clip that we were tasked to recreate:

            </video>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2 class="paragraph">My role within the project</h2>
        I was tasked to create and setup the enemies. I had to handle their spawning, combat and their navigation around the map. Handling their spawning and navigation was actually pretty easy as I had worked with spawning in my last project so I could just reuse the code from that project. Enemy navigation was easy in particular because Unity actually has systems in place that take care of the all the logic related to navigation. Instead of having to create a movement system, constantly checking the position of the player and all that stuff I can just assign something called a NavMeshAgent. A NavMeshAgent is a component within Unity that you can add so that an object automatically moves towards a set destination and handles all the pathfinding required to get to your destination. All you have to do really is write one line of code, as seen below, and Unity does the rest of the work.

        <h2 class="paragraph">The struggles</h2>
        The hardest part of all of this was combat. The enemy in the shown in the video lunges at you to deal damage which means I had to work with melee combat for the first time. The way I handled combat was actually quite simple in theory. Just check if we're colliding with the player and if we were, attack every 2 seconds with the help of a timer. But in reality it was a lot harder because I had to figure out a way to check collision and on top of that I also had to ANIMATE the attack. Thankfully one of the artists already made the animations for me so I didn't have to mess with animating. I did however have to learn to assign a "state" to the enemy which defines what the enemy is currently doing.
        <br>
        <h2 class="paragraph">What did I learn from all of this?</h2>
        First off, this project was the perfect opportunity to apply everything I've learned about agile developement. Truly made me realize how efficient it is to make sure you can actually commit to a project and get stuff done in time. Secondly, I learned how to work with animations in Unity so that's another area I can add to my expertise.
        And lastly, I learned how to work with Unity's AI & Navigation tools so I didn't have to do that much work on the enemy in the first place.
        <br>
        <h2 class="paragraph">Conclusion & final result</h2>
        It was a fun project. I got to team up with 2 of my friends to do this and we got to recreate one of our most favorite games. We got scarily close to the real deal and I'm honestly convinced the creators of ULTRAKILL would either think it's cool or hit us with a cease and desist. We even recreated the start menu. Shoutout to Joons, SSeinaru, Del, Valeni, DJ_Glitterbibs & Driply, everybody did amazing and should be proud of what they contributed to this project.
        <br>
        <br>
        With all of that said, here is the final project.
