                    I’m out, for now.

I’m currently at my lowest, my social battery is drained completely and I’m about to fucking break into a quadrillion pieces. I’m taking a break off social media for god knows how long. I will probably be extending this break into IRL too. 75% of the interactions I’ve had the past few weeks were negative and it isn’t helping. Especially after my friends’ birthday dinner where I felt like I was being made fun of and secretly judged behind my back during the afterparty. I’m depressed, literally. On top of that, a friend who I thought I could trust made fun of me after I sent him a selfie on snap. As the cherry on top of the cake my home situation is horrible because I have constant fights with my siblings and my parents tell me to man up because I’m supposed to be some emotionless soulless perfect robot. I’m not. I’m fed up of everybody and everything. But everybody thinks I’m a joke who needs constant attention. At this point? I don’t want any attention anymore. It’s all just negative anyway. People reach out to me just for me to regret the interaction after it all ended. I’m tired, I need to rest. I’m close to my breaking point, REALLY CLOSE. We’re talking millimeters. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on honestly. I’m hanging by a thread.

A select few of my mutuals, IRLs or just friends in general can expect responses when they reach out. The rest is recommended to be saved for later.
