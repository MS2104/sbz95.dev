                    I specialize in C# and work alot with the Unity game engine. I’ve made numerous projects already in Unity and plan on making this my main engine to work with. I have also helped develop a VR game in Unreal Engine so I do know my way around that UE aswell. I also have a slight bit of experience with HTML & CSS. I’ve worked with JavaScript in the past as well but I have not created any projects in the language due to not being interested in it. I also have some experience with Python having built some terminal programs. I’m currently doing Game Developement in college and I’m scheduled to finish in 2026. During my time in college I’ve already developed agile skills and am able to work like real studios do.

                My name is Milad Sahar and I am a 20 year old. I was born in 2004 in the suburbs of Amsterdam into a migrant family freshly arrived from Afghanistan. Growing up I loved games a lot and kinda knew from the start that when I grew up I was going to make games somehow, whether that be indie on the side or working on the next AAA game. I’m very much a people person, I love going out for drinks or just hiking as long as I’m out with my friends doing anything. I also put a lot of hours sandbox games like Minecraft and make amateur music with my friends. Whenever I’m doing anything I always have some music playing in the background. I usually listen to anything but I’m a big fan of R&amp;B, rap and I’m also a huge metalhead. I listen to artists like Frank Ocean, Brent Faiyaz, The Weeknd, Travis Scott, Bring Me The Horizon, Bad Omens and Sleep Token.
